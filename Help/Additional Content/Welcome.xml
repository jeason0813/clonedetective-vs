				Clone Detective is a Visual Studio integration that allows you to analyze C# projects
				for source code that is duplicated somewhere else. Having duplicates can easily lead
				to inconsistencies and often is an indicator for poorly factored code. Clone Detective
				uses <a href="http://conqat.cs.tum.edu" target="_blank">ConQAT</a> to perform the clone
				detection.
